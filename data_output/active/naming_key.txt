	- yields a dataset with 21 transects of variable nrow, totaling 140,800 percent-cover points
		
T3-2 indicates that the data have been randomly sampled down to 50 rows; instances where nrow < 50 are retained at their current level. 
	- yields a dataset with 21 transects of variable nrow, totaling 101,100 percent-cover points

T3-3 indicates that any transects with < 50 rows were dropped entirely; transects with nrow > 50 were randomly sampled down to 50
	- yields a dataset with 18 transects comprised of 50 rows (50 photos) per transect, precisely 90,000 percent-cover points
