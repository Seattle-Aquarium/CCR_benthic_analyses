	- yields a dataset with 21 transects of variable nrow, totaling 140,800 percent-cover points
		
T3-2 is a dataset that has been randomly sampled down to 50 rows; instances where nrow < 50 are retained at their current level. 
	- yields a dataset with 21 transects of variable nrow(), totaling 101,100 percent-cover points

T3-3 indicates that any transects with < 50 rows were dropped entirely; transects with nrow > 50 were randomly sampled down to 50
