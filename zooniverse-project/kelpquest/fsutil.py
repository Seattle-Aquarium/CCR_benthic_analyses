"""
Publishing finished files into the flight folder.

Outputs land in a Dropbox-synced folder, so another process may well hold a
handle to the file we are about to replace: Dropbox itself uploading the
previous version, an antivirus scanner, Explorer building a thumbnail, or --
most likely of all for the telemetry CSV -- Excel, with the last run's file
still open.

On Windows that surfaces as WinError 32 and, until this module existed, killed
the run at the final step with every minute of encoding already spent. So a
publish waits for the lock to clear, and if it truly will not, writes alongside
under a numbered name rather than throwing the work away.
